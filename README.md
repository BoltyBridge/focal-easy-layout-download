# focal-easy-layout-download
all the files to easily download and install the focal keyboard layout to the windows American keyboard.
just download the zip file and run the installer, than you can delete the files once it's done.
for some reason it doesn't say focal in the task bar once selected from settings but it is still the correct layout.
